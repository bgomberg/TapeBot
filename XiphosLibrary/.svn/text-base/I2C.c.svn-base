I2C Library, also known as TWI (Two-Wire Interface)
Darron Baida May 2009

This library provides a set of functions to make it easier to communicate with 
I2C/TWI devices, and is intended to cover a large variety of devices. These 
functions are currently all implemented in the least-efficient fashion, using 
blocking while loops that wait for flags to be set. They should be sufficient 
for most simple applications, but if you need the best possible performance you
should consider writing I2C interrupt handlers or a non-blocking task loop 
instead. However, even if you choose to implement a faster alternative, these 
functions should provide some hints about how to write I2C code, though you 
should also refer to the datasheet for your ATmega chip. Please be aware that 
due to the blocking nature of this implementation, it is possible for these 
functions to get stuck waiting for a flag condition that may never occur, 
effectively halting your program. This can happen if the I2C device is not 
communicating properly.

To decide which function is appropriate for your I2C device, read the datasheet
for the device to see if it uses addressable registers. If not, then you can 
simply read and write to the device using:
i2cReadByteFromDevice(u08 address) and
i2cSendByteToDevice(u08 address, u08 data)

For both reading and writing functions, you must always pass in the device 
address with the least significant bit (LSB) set to 0. In other words, the 
address you pass must always be an even number. In read mode, if there is an 
error, 0 will be returned. If it is possible that your data byte could be 0, 
you must check the error register yourself or else comment out the error checking.
A better way is to use the i2cReadDataFromRegisters function which returns a 1 for success and 0 for error in addition to loading the desired array with the received data.
If your device uses a 1 byte addressable register scheme, use i2cSendByteToRegister(u08 address, u08 reg, u08 data), i2cReadByteFromRegister(u08 address, u08 reg),
i2cSendDataToRegisters(u08 address, u08 reg, u08 byteCount, u08 data[]), and i2cReadDataFromRegisters(u08 address, u08 reg, u08 byteCount, u08 *data)
This last function is special because the last parameter is an initialized array which your data will be loaded in to. See example code for details.
If your device uses 2-byte addressable registers, like an EEPROM or something, use the functions ending in "2". This allows a u16 register address to be sent.
